## 🌌 Vision

**The TARS Project** aims to bring fiction to function — building real-world tools, interfaces, and systems modeled after futuristic technology seen in science fiction. Think J.A.R.V.I.S., Rinzler’s grid, or HAL-9000 (minus the evil part 😅).

Whether it’s holographic UIs, voice-activated systems, or sleek control panels, TARS is about making imagination usable.

## 🧩 Project Modules

This organization hosts multiple repositories, each representing a "module" in the TARS ecosystem:

- [`system-monitor`](https://github.com/THE-TARS-PROJECT/system-monitor) – Vortex-UI based first application for monitoring system resources.
- [`tars-de`](https://github.com/THE-TARS-PROJECT/tars-de)

## 🔭 Future Plans

The TARS Project is just beginning its journey. Here's a glimpse into what lies ahead in our development roadmap:

- **🛰️ TARS OS**  
  A modular, themed desktop environment based on Vortex-UI delivering sci-fi aesthetics while maintaing usability and performance.

- **🌐 Communication Service**  
  Remember the phone call between Tony Stark and Ivan Wanko ? Get similar aesthetics and functionality while calling. NO TRACKING THOUGH .

- MORE COMING SOON
